AndroidSmoothAccordion
======================

Android Accordion created with a ListView instead of a ExpandableListView. 

It has a smooth effect both when opening the inside element and to the allignment to the top of the accordion. 

The code is "quick-and-dirty" and based on https://github.com/tjerkw/Android-SlideExpandableListView but fully working.

If you want to copy the code to create something more "reusable"/"cleaned" feel free to do it (if you do, it would be nice to tell me :) )
